# Starbucks-Delivery-Route-Optimisation
Imagine a time when you are operating a business and have multiple stores in an area and delivering raw materials and goods to them is a huge part of keeping the business running. Along with goods, comes the question of logistics, how many deliverymen and trucks to employ to get the job done, what routes should these trucks follow? How much fuel would taking a particular route or how much time would taking a particular route take and how much would it cost you.
